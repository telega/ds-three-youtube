doomsday clock","We invite you to join us in assessing what it means for the internet to be healthy, and to participate in setting an agenda for how we can work together to create an internet that truly puts people first","Our intention with this compilation of research, interviews and analysis (designed with input from hundreds of readers in collaboration with over experts) is to show that while the worldwide consequences of getting things wrong with the internet could be huge – for peace and security, for political and individual freedoms, for human equality – the problems are never so great that nothing can be done","More people than you imagine are working to make the internet healthier, and getting things right, by applying their skills, creativity, and even personal bravery, to business, technology, activism, policy and regulation, education and community development","This annual report is a call to action to recognize the things that are having an impact on the internet today through research and analysis, and to embrace the notion that we as humans can change how we make money, govern societies, and interact with one another online","Part of the trouble in explaining how to make the internet ‘healthier’ is that so much goes unseen","As internet users, we tend not to think about fibre optic cables beneath the seas, or Readme Is the internet

assemble our electronic devices, let alone about the decision processes coded into “intelligent” machines","Many of us don’t even know how our favorite internet companies profit, or how our personal desires and traits are tracked as we go about our lives","If we’re completely honest, a lot of us would probably prefer not to know","Why ruin the magic of the instant gratification we get at the push of a button, hiding all technological processes behind the scenes","The downside is that we often don’t recognize the things in need of systemic change before the dramatic news headlines assault us","We prefer to imagine that we are protected: by high tech internet companies, by governments, by other more savvy users","We make choices all the time: about what software to use, what security risks to take, what steps to take to protect the privacy of our children and genetic relatives","As advocates for a healthier internet, let’s now make better choices","Let’s fight to change what is

the expanding capabilities of machines to “learn” and “make decisions”","How do we begin to make tougher demands of artificial intelligence to meet our human needs above all others","By now, you’ve surely heard that targeted advertising ads and personal data collection are at the heart of so much that is wrong with the internet","What are promising efforts to make things right","More than half of the world’s population lives in a city now","You had better believe that officials face tough challenges (and divergent interests) when it comes to putting ideals for a healthier internet into practice","No, this is not about “smart cities”, but about the untapped power of city governments and civil society to work together to make the internet healthier worldwide","Contact us: For press inquiries visit: internethealthreport","org/press The creative studio and digital agency Rainbow Unicorn in Berlin, Germany developed the visual design and code, Christian Laesser developed the data visualizations and Julian Braun produced the D artwork","The entire report will be translated by Global Voices from English to French, Spanish and German (with staggered launch dates)","Credits Let’s ask more of AI Stefania Druga from Romania teaches artificial intelligence (AI) programming to children","As a researcher, she has also studied how children in seven countries interact with and perceive connected toys and home assistants, like Amazon Alexa or Google Home","Children can understand more than parents think, she says — including that machine learning is limited by what training data you have to work with","The philosophy behind the software she developed for teaching is that if children are given the opportunity for agency in their relationship with “smart” technologies, they can actively decide how they would like them to behave","Children gather data and teach their computers","This simple approach is what we urgently need to replicate in other realms of society","In order to navigate what implications AI has for humanity, we need to understand it — and then decide what we want it to do","Use of AI is skyrocketing (for fun, as well as for governance, military and business) and not nearly enough attention is paid to the associated risks","“Yup, it’s probably AI,” says Karen Hao’s back of the-envelope-explainer about any technologies that can listen, speak, read, move and reason","Without necessarily being aware of it, anybody who uses the internet today is already interacting with some form of AI automation","Thought of simply, machine learning and AI technologies are just the next generation of computing","They enable more powerful automation, prediction and personalization","These technologies represent such a fundamental shift in what is possible with networked computers that they will soon likely make even more headway into our lives","Whether search engine results, music playlists, or map navigation routes, these processes are far from magical","Humans code “algorithms” which are basically formulas that decide how decisions should be automated based on whatever data is fed into them","Where it begins to feel magical is when it makes new things possible","This Person Does Not Exist is a good example","If you visit the website and refresh the page, you will be shown an endless array of faces of people who never existed","They are images that are generated at random by a machine learning algorithm composite based on a database of faces that do exist","Look closely, and you will spot the errors — ears that are crooked, hair that doesn’t fall naturally, backgrounds that are blurred","This Cat Does Not Exist is less convincing","The potential exists for either photo generator to improve with additional data and guidance","And the risks that such photos could be used to misrepresent reality also exists, even for such whimsical creations","In recognition of the dangers of malicious applications of a similar technology, researchers from OpenAI sparked a media storm by announcing they would not release the full version of an AI technology that can automatically write realistic texts, based partly on the content of million web pages","“Due to our concerns about malicious applications of the technology, we are not releasing the trained model,” they wrote, calling it an experiment in “responsible disclosure”","Such recognition of the faultlines and risks for abuse of AI technologies is too rare","Over the last years, the same large tech companies that control social media and e-commerce, in both the United States and China, have helped shape the AI agenda","Through their ability to gather huge quantities of training data, they can develop even more powerful technology","And they do it at a breakneck pace that seems incompatible with real care for the potential harms and externalities Amazon, Microsoft and others have forged ahead with direct sales of facial recognition technology to law enforcement and immigration authorities, even though troubling inaccuracies and serious risks to people of color in the United States have been rigorously documented and defended","Within major internet companies that develop AI technologies, including Amazon and Google, employees have sounded alarms over ethical concerns more urgently","Company leaders deflect with confidence in their business models, hubris about their accuracy, and what appears to be ignorance or lack of care for the huge risks","Several companies, including Axxon, Salesforce, and Facebook, have sought to allay concerns over controversies by creating ethics boards that are meant to oversee decisions","Co-founder of the research institute, AI Now, Meredith Whittaker, calls this “ethics theater” and says there is no evidence that product decisions are run by them, or that they have any actual veto power","In an interview with Recode, Whittaker asked of the companies, “Are you going to harm humanity and, specifically, historically marginalized populations, or are you going to sort of get your act together and make some significant structural changes to ensure that what you create is safe and not harmful","” As it happens, Google’s announcement of an ethics board backfired spectacularly in April and was dismantled after employee protests and public outrage about who had (and hadn’t) been asked to join","While the company has been vocal about establishing principles for AI, and has engaged in social good projects, it also has competing priorities across its many ventures","What are real world ethical challenges these boards could tackle if they took Whittaker’s advice","One idea would be to question an everyday function billions of people are affected by","Google’s video platform, YouTube, is often said to be a “rabbit hole” –– endless tunnels leading from one video to another","Though YouTube denies it, research shows that content recommendation algorithms are fueling a crisis of disinformation and cultish behavior about vaccines, cancer, gender discrimination, terrorism, conspiracy theories and [add your topic]","Similarly, Pinterest and Amazon are also platforms that drive engagement by learning and suggesting new and engaging content","They experience variations of the same problem","In response to public scandals, they have each announced efforts to stop anti-vaccine content, but there is little evidence of any real change in the basic intention or function of these systems","But it’s not just technology companies that need to be interrogating the ethics of how they use AI","It’s everyone, from city and government agencies to banks and insurers","At the borders of nine European Union countries, an AI lie detector was tested to screen travelers","Systems to determine creditworthiness are being rolled out to populations in emerging markets in Africa and Asia","In the United States, health insurers are accessing social media data to help inform decisions about who should have access to what health care","AI has even been used to decide who should and shouldn’t be kept in prison in the United States","Are these implementations of AI ethical","Do they respect human rights","China, famously, has begun scoring citizens through a social credit system","Chinese authorities are now also systematically targeting an oppressed minority through surveillance with facial recognition systems","Where do we draw the line","There are basically two distinct challenges for the world right now","We need to fix what we know we are doing

AI Now Institute, Cutting humans out of government and business processes can make them more efficient and save costs, but sometimes too much is lost in the bargain","Too rarely, do people ask, should we do this","Does it even work","It’s worth questioning whether AI should ever be used to make predictions, or whether we should so freely allow it into our homes","Some of the most worst missteps have involved training data that is faulty or simply used with no recognition of the serious biases that influenced its collection and analysis","For instance, some automated systems that screen job applicants consistently give women negative scores, because the data shows it’s a field currently dominated by men","“The categories of data collection matter deeply, especially when dividing people into groups,” say the authors of the book Data Feminism, which explores how data-driven decisions will only amplify inequality unless conscious steps are taken to mitigate the risks","It seems that if we leave it up to the nine big companies that dominate the field of AI alone, we raise the spectre of a corporate controlled world of surveillance and conformity — especially so long as gender, ethnic and global diversity is also lacking among their ranks of employees at all levels of a company","Having engineers, ethicists and human rights experts address collaboratively how AI should work increases the chance for better outcomes for humanity","We are merely at the beginning of articulating a clear and compelling narrative of the future we want","Over the past years, a movement to better understand the challenges that AI presents to the world has begun to take root","Digital rights specialists, technologists, journalists and researchers around the globe have in different ways urged companies, governments, military and law enforcement agencies to acknowledge the ethical quandaries, inaccuracies and risks","Each and everyone of us who cares about the health of the internet — we need to scale up our understanding of AI","It is being woven into nearly every kind of digital product and is being applied to more and more decisions that affect people around the world","For our common understanding to evolve, we need to share what we learn","In classrooms, Stefania Druga is making a small dent by working with groups of children","In Finland, a grand initiative sought to train of the country’s population (, people) in the elements of AI","What will you do","Rethinking digital ads When dozens of people fell gravely ill from eating romaine lettuce in , public health authorities in the United States and Canada could not figure out where the E","coli contaminated leaves were farmed","The lettuce had changed hands so many times from washing, chopping, packing to shelving that they couldn’t retrace the steps","The only option was to temporarily declare all romaine lettuce, from any source, unsafe","It’s a stretch of the imagination, but let’s compare that to what we are experiencing in the world of “personalised” or “targeted” digital ads","We have absolutely no idea of the ingredients that go into the daily bread of the internet","The ads we are served as we use mobile apps and browse the Web are like lettuce leaves scattered over the planet — they can be healthy — but information about the supply chain is muddled and we have no way to understand what is happening","Pretty much everything we do when we interact with the internet can be tracked by someone (or something) without our knowledge","From the websites we visit, to the apps on our phones, to the things we write in emails or say to voice assistants","We have no way of knowing how this big salad of data may be combined by different companies with information that uniquely identifies us","It appears that collecting data about everything and anything we do is of commercial interest to someone, whether app developers, insurance agents, data brokers, hackers or scammers","The lines have been blurred between what’s public and private information","Your credit card may share a list of what you buy in stores with Google","Your online dating profile has perhaps been copied and resold","Why is this","Not all data about you is used to sell ads, but it is primarily because of the ad-driven internet economy that data has become such a hot commodity","It is why people now speak of surveillance capitalism and the attention economy","The phrase “You are the product” precedes the internet, but has gained new currency as a way to explain how so much online can be “free”","Personal data may seem like a small price to pay","But the added social tax is now mounting threats to freedom and human rights","To talk about the positives: Digital ads have been a boon to the global economy","Free online services have driven the uptake of mobile internet around the world","Ads have helped publishers and startups monetize their online content and services","For some of the most powerful companies of the internet, Google, Facebook and Baidu, ads are a primary source of revenue even as they have expanded their business into multiple directions and geographies","For Google and Facebook, especially, access to data is a source of global market power and leverage for business negotiations","For the first time, in the United States, digital ad spending is bigger than for print and television","The ad-tech industry is vast, but by some estimates Facebook and Google alone controlled around of the global digital ad market in outside of China","To succeed, they have developed product design practices which are centered on holding the user’s attention and maximizing engagement to drive revenue from ads","Targeted ads for the most part promote run of the mill products and services, but these same tools can just as easily be exploited by people with criminal or hateful intentions","In a few minutes, you can place content on videos in YouTube, news feeds of Twitter and Facebook, and search results of Google","By selecting what demographic to target, advertisers on some platforms have been spotted excluding people of a certain race or gender from housing or job ads","Or in the case of Facebook, even directly targeting “affinity groups” like “Jew Haters” (yes, really)","Facebook said its categories are created by algorithms, and when confronted said it would make changes, but it begs the question of how much data should be collected and what it should ever be used for","Your data profile is a sandwich of data that you knowingly or unknowingly share, which is interpreted by secret algorithms that make use of statistical correlations","For instance, searching online for “loan payment” might say something about your finances","And if you “like” articles or join Facebook groups that could help define your affinities","“Ads can be done in a more privacy friendly way","But publicly-traded corporations have a duty to maximize shareholder profits, which for some companies means squeezing every drop of data out of their users,” says Casey Oppenheim, the CEO of Disconnect, an online privacy tool that blocks trackers and helps guard personal information from prying technologies","The journey to a comparison with a public health crisis (remember the lettuce",") is in no small part due to the fact that the ad-tech industry, despite a focus on “better ads”, has neglected privacy for years and still faces accusations of skirting privacy and consent today","Even the supposed accuracy with which the value of an ad purchase can be seen is a myth","It’s an open secret that a huge portion of the internet traffic directed to ads is actually from bots and not humans","An estimated","billion USD are lost to fraud by advertisers globally in because of websites that cash in from using bots to inflate numbers","Many advertisers are angry and have demanded more transparency in the supply chain","“Silicon Valley has created a fetish around automation,” says Rory Sutherland","He is the vice chairman of the advertising agency Ogilvy in the United Kingdom, and says an obsession with measuring results of targeting has led to a decline in the quality of ads compared with traditional mass media marketing","“The obsession with targeting means what you are rewarding is your algorithm’s facility at identifying a customer,” he says","He compares it to walking into a pub with a piece of paper that says, “Drink beer","” Most people are already there to drink beer, he says","“What about the people outside","” In , a number of major marketers stopped placing ads on YouTube after a slew of scandals over ads on violent and inappropriate videos","For the general global public it can be jarring to see such content monetized","It adds to the sneaking sense of discomfort that is growing among many internet users for every report of breached data, security flaws, and too-farreaching data sharing agreements with other companies","Can we really trust these companies with our data","As internet users we may have more ‘awareness’ about privacy, but still no clear sense of what to do","We are deeply dependent on companies we wish would protect us","In a restaurant, a food and safety inspector has a checklist of things to look for that may be a danger to public health","The Corporate Accountability Index of the organization Ranking Digital Rights is a kind of checklist too — but a complex one that ranks what the biggest internet and telecom companies disclose about how they protect the privacy and freedom of expression of users","By publicly scoring companies — and none scores high — the small but influential organization creates an incentive for companies to improve year over year, and a method to track noticeable progress and setbacks over time","Natalie Maréchal is a senior research analyst with Ranking Digital Rights in Washington D","C","Further reading: A Grand Bargain to Make Tech Companies Trustworthy, Jack M","Balkin, Jonathan Zittrain, The Atlantic, It’s time for a Bill of Data Rights, Martin Tisne, MIT Technology Review, Corporate Accountability Index, Ranking Digital Rights She is leading an open consultation process to create entirely new indicators for the index related to targeted advertising","“We need to decide together, what standards for disclosure and good practice should be used to hold these companies accountable,” she says","Ranking Digital Rights’ current ideas for best practices will sound familiar to many internet researchers and digital rights organizations","Among other things, they suggest companies should allow third-party oversight of the parameters for ads (eg","“affinities”) and of who is paying for them","And that companies should state rules for prohibited content and use of bots — and publish data regularly to show how they are enforced","Such tools and practices have begun to emerge out of companies already","Not of their own initiative, but compelled either by regulations or public pressure","This year, Facebook says they will roll out political ad transparency tools globally by June","In , Google say they killed over two billion “bad ads”","And Facebook took steps to remove , ad categories to prevent discrimination","Twitter began collecting more personal data in , but now also gives you to control to change how they categorize you","Data privacy regulations are improving in numerous countries and states, and courts and civil society are taking companies to task around the world on matters of data collection and consent for targeted advertising","Regulation helps","And so does technology","To protect the security of users, most major browsers have introduced different variations of tracking protection (and sometimes also ad blocking)","Total or partial ad blocking by different companies in different configurations has gone fully mainstream with hundreds of millions of users","It makes the Web faster, and batteries last longer","Coming back to the lettuce","What would the equivalent of “farm to table” in food activism be for digital ads","Perhaps we would see who paid for ads, understand why we are targeted, and have control over who is collecting our data for what","What really needs rethinking today is the notion that digital ads can only be effective when they are targeted, and when companies know everything about everyone","Many brands and marketers are backing away from this idea for lack of evidence","Unless internet companies are able to regain our trust by changing practices (or perhaps be legally compelled to protect our secrets and interests, like doctors and lawyers), we can invest some hope in a new generation of software initiatives that explore decentralized solutions to give people personal control over who has access to their data","“I spent years working with an environmental health organization and I have always seen parallels to the privacy world,” says Oppenheim","“Just like we can connect people to the values of the food they eat, we can also connect them to the value of their data","” The power of cities When the Amazon Kindle was released, their ebooks didn’t work with commonly used screen readers, making accessibility difficult for the blind community","The National Federation of the Blind (NFB) in the United States campaigned to change this for years, in vain","Then Amazon won a million USD contract with the New York City Department of Education in to create an ebook store for educators in , schools","City schools delayed a final vote until Amazon and the NFB came to an understanding","Since then, the Kindle now has a built in screen reader and Amazon has improved accessibility across many products","This is an example of how cities have huge potential power to improve the health of the internet ecosystem","In this case, it was a win for children and educators in New York, but also for people around the world","Where consumers may have a hard time persuading giant corporations to do something that they perceive as going against their business interests, a million dollar procurement contract and a commitment to serving the public interest can help","More than half of the people in the world now live in cities and by that number is expected to rise to","Cities are where wealth and power is concentrated in most countries, and also where many technology initiatives are rolled out and tested in communities","What we may think of as local decisions today, may be of global consequence in the future","When the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) of the United States backed away from protecting net neutrality in , a network of city mayors formed to use their combined purchasing power to support internet providers who continued upholding net neutrality","“In NYC alone, we spend over million annually to provide internet service to city employees and to offer city services","So, we convened an ad hoc coalition, starting with eight cities committed to only purchasing from broadband providers that honor net neutrality principles","Now, this coalition is over cities,” says Max Sevilia, the Director of External Affairs for the NYC Mayor’s Office of the Chief Technology Officer","This story and many others are highlighted in a publication called the New York City Internet Health Report","Its creator, Meghan McDermott, adapted the format of the global Internet Health Report as part of a Mozilla fellowship project to explore among other things how cities can be strong advocates for digital rights by nurturing relationships with civic tech communities","“The core of the digital rights agenda is to reframe how we think about and deploy technology in cities","The idea is to recapture the dignity and purpose of technology as a public good,” says McDermott, who has worked at the intersection of education and digital rights for years — formerly as director of strategy for Mozilla’s Hive Learning Networks, a peer community for digital literacy","When the internet and connected devices are applied to solving problems in cities, it tends to be referred to as a ‘smart city’ initiative","These are often projects to improve the efficiency of energy, transportation or any number of government services","For instance, it could be trash cans with sensors that alert waste management authorities when they need emptying, or parking meters that can help people find free parking spaces in crowded streets","Such futuristic ideas have excited city officials around the world, and the global market for ‘smart city’ technologies is worth hundreds of billions of dollars and growing","But frankly it’s also an industry where corporate interests and techno-utopianism holds high currency — where flying taxis and autonomous helicopters end up described as a solution to traffic congestion, even though they most likely won’t solve anything for people who rely on public transport","The harshest critics say a hype about ‘smart cities’ has led to massive investments in what is essentially surveillance technology under the guise of technological progress","In both resource rich and poor cities, there are cameras, sensors, microphones, and huge multi-year procurement contracts with companies that have questionable data practices","In this way, with scant attention to data privacy, the internet has arrived to cities worldwide, for better or worse","Where some see an opportunity to entirely rethink how cities collect data about neighborhoods to improve services, others see a lack of transparency and a recipe for a civil rights disaster spurred on by corporate interests","Where some see energy efficient LED streetlights that help gather data about pedestrians with cameras, others see a surveillance dragnet encroaching on freedom in public space and putting vulnerable populations at risk","Time and again, there are design choices that could be made to minimize the risk of abuse","For instance, when could it be preferable for privacy to use a thermal sensor to collect crowd data instead of a camera","Digital rights advocates are cast as enemies to progress in such conflicts, but it really boils down to a core difference in opinion about whose interests technology should serve, how to seed social innovation, and what data should be used (or not) in the public interest","Consider the electronic sensors in the garbage cans","To some, that’s a great example of how technology can help cities operate more efficiently","To others, like Tamas Erkelens who is the program manager of data innovation in the mayor’s office of the City of Amsterdam, it’s evidence of a wasteful approach that characterizes many ‘smart city’ innovations","“We wouldn’t need sensors in every trash can if cities could have Google Map data to see where crowds are,” says Erkelens","“Wherever people are convening is a good enough indicator of where there is likely to be more trash","We can then use sensors just to train the models, rather than to create new data by machines with batteries that need to be changed,” he says","Many city governments and open data advocates worldwide peer enviously at the wealth of data held by internet companies like Google, Uber, Apple and Airbnb knowing that it could help them understand crucial things about traffic, housing and employment","In , the Open Data Institute in the United Kingdom published a report suggesting that mapping data companies should be compelled to share geospatial data with rival firms and the public sector, to stop “data monopolies” from forming and to create better opportunities for innovation","Some companies do share aggregated data with city planners, including Uber, but cities are also getting smarter about requesting things like usage data of electric scooters upfront as a condition of doing business","The city of Barcelona is one of very few cities that operates under the principle that all data collected in the duty of local government in public space must be available in a data commons platform","Erkelens says Amsterdam is using its annual procurement budget of €","billion to help guarantee good terms for data privacy too, and that Barcelona and Amsterdam together are experimenting with partners in the European Union to develop new technologies that also give citizens more direct control over their own data","At the Smart Cities Expo World Congress in Barcelona in November , the chief technology officers of Amsterdam, Barcelona and New York together launched the Cities Coalition for Digital Rights in partnership with UN-Habitat, a United Nations program to support urban development","Cities who join the coalition agree to a declaration of just five principles that center on respect for privacy and human rights in use of the internet","They pledged to see cities join in days (before July) and cities have joined so far","Declarations may come and go, but these cities aim to sow the seeds of a movement whereby cities decisively claim digital rights","By working together and establishing best practices they will attempt to win a race against technological progress that is not centered on principles of human dignity and inclusivity","Despite the strong stances taken in New York, Barcelona and Amsterdam, people who do digital rights work at the city level describe an uphill battle of culture change within large and in some parts traditional institutions with multiple agencies and divergent interests","Creating the policies and processes by which all agencies can make better decisions about privacy, data and transparency — and opening up key parts of the work to civil society — is a key part of the challenge","This is where the civic tech community has blossomed in countless cities","Diverse groups of public interest startups, technical students, officials, and engaged citizens team up to hack bureaucracy and code in an attempt to make cities more responsive to their residents","They work from the inside with willing partners, and from the outside through advocacy groups, research, and live prototypes that reimagine how more responsive systems could work","Cities worldwide are on the frontline of decisions that affect the health of the internet for all people","At the local level, whether in rural or urban communities, there are opportunities for civic engagement regarding the internet that can be more direct than at the national level","We should seize opportunities to influence how technology is used (or isn’t) in our own communities, and encourage elected officials to be champions of digital rights","The more engaged we are locally, the more empowered cities will be to cast themselves as opponents to internet policies at the national or international level when they go against the interests of people","The challenge for cities is to advance the intentional adoption of digital tools that advance values of diversity, inclusion and fairness that they already hold, rather than jumping on the latest ‘smart city’ trend","When he helped facilitate conversations between Amazon and The National Federation of the Blind over ebooks, Walei Sabry in New York already worked in the M ayor’s Office of People with Disabilities","Since then he has also become New York City’s first official digital accessibility coordinator","About ‘smart cities’ he says, “These initiatives can go really well or really wrong depending on who’s at the table — people with disabilities must be involved at all stages of the process… because what works for us makes products better for everyone","” Is it safe","The internet is where we could live, love, learn and communicate freely","To be ourselves, we need to be able to trust the systems that protect us","A tectonic shift in public awareness about privacy and security in the digital world has occurred in the past year","Some are even calling it “the great privacy awakening","” In , news broke that data analytics firm Cambridge Analytica had harvested data of millions of Facebook users, without their knowledge, and used it for political purposes — including attempts to influence elections in the United Kingdom and the United States","Public outrage was swift and widespread","Campaigns to make Facebook private by default and to ask users to delete the platform outright took off","Nearly three-quarters of Americans and Canadians reported tightening their Facebook security or distancing themselves from the site altogether","Facebook was grilled in the U","S","Congress and the Canadian House of Commons, fined by the U","K","and sued by the District of Columbia","The company’s stock plummeted","All this was a symptom of a much larger, systemic issue: the dominant business model and currency of today’s digital world is based on gathering and selling data about us","Our datarich digital age have some benefits","Streaming music services recommend songs, based on what we’ve listened to","Voice recognition technology lowers barriers to access to the internet","City planners have access to more data","Yet, as devices on our streets and in our homes gather more data, a fundamental question remains: Are we too exposed","Does our awareness extend to making informed choices about commercial DNA tests","Or the privacy settings for apps and online services","We should know the risks of ransomware attacks, why strong passwords are vital and how to judge the security of devices we buy","We can also support products and services that protect and respect our privacy — like the Tor and Firefox browsers — and demand that other companies do better","But the responsibility for a healthy internet cannot rest on the shoulders of individuals alone","Just in , millions of people were affected by breaches at Google, Facebook, Quora, Marriott and many others","Over billion Indian citizens were put at risk by a vulnerability in Aadhaar, the government’s biometric ID system","Telecommunications providers, including Telus, AT&T and Sprint, were caught selling customers’ location data","We need more protection from companies and governments","There were also bright spots in the last year","Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) came into effect, and digital rights organizations are collaborating to ensure it is enforced","Public pressure caused several hackable toys to be pulled off the shelves","Mark Zuckerberg recently stated that he is committed to “a privacy-focused vision for social networking","” But Facebook is also under criminal investigation for data sharing deals with companies including Amazon, Apple, Microsoft and Sony","It’s going to take more than words to rebuild the trust that’s been lost, not only with Facebook but in the internet overall","Calls for more privacy regulation are on the rise around the world, some inspired by the idea that companies should treat our data with the same care that a bank would treat our money","The debate about the dominant business model of the internet — and its implications for the privacy and security of our digital lives — will undoubtedly continue in the years to come","As it does, it’s important that we remember the current reality is a human creation, not a technological inevitability","We built this digital world, and we have the power to change it","Ransomware payments add up We don’t know who is making the payments, or who is receiving them","But by looking at the

internet","Half a million homes were damaged, thousands of people died","By some estimates, the territory experienced the worst power failure in U","S","history","Extreme weather caused by climate change increases the likelihood that disaster will strike again soon – in Puerto Rico and around the world – and that once again, loss of internet will make a humanitarian crisis even harder to overcome","“We’re talking about humans of flesh and bone [who died] because of telecommunications, because you couldn’t pick up the phone or message someone,” said Puerto Rican journalist Sandra Rodriguez in an interview with NOVA Next about the internet outages","The internet is designed to be resilient","But after Hurricane Maria in , as Puerto Ricans rushed to contact friends and family, many found they couldn’t get online","When a hurricane zaps the internet Loiza Puerto Rico six months after Hurricane Maria","Photo by Preston Keres (public domain)","Following Hurricane Maria, Puerto Rico’s internet problems soon spread","Several countries in South America that rely on submarine cables that land on the Caribbean island, including Argentina and Brazil, experienced network disruptions in September due to power failures","A variety of small and big scale initiatives to restore the internet blossomed","The non-profit NetHope sent and installed WiFi equipment","Telecom companies deployed mobile hotspots","Google’s Project Loon delivered internet via balloons","Still, it took nearly a year to restore power to the whole island, and average internet speeds did not reach pre-storm levels until August , according to NOVA Next","With hurricane season looming every year, Puerto Rican internet advocates are pushing for measures to fortify the internet for the next big storm","In February , The Internet Society (ISOC), a nonprofit that champions internet access for all, issued a report informed by their Caribbean chapters of what could be done to prevent another connectivity disaster","Electricity is a must-have","But the island’s natural geography and historic planning makes energy supply tricky","For instance, while most of Puerto Rico’s","million people live in northern metropolitan areas, of power generation happens in the south","That awkward centralization means the grid system has to cut across the island, exposing wires to the elements","Distributing power up Puerto Rico’s mountains is also difficult and costly","After the power outage, cell towers relied on backup generators","Once the generator fuel ran out, “You couldn’t get to the towers because the roads were blocked, so antennas started to drop off because they didn’t have power","It was messy,” said Eduardo Diaz, a director of the ISOC Puerto Rico board who is also assembling an advisory committee to help develop the chapter’s strategic plan","Diaz says local loss of confidence in the grid is driving new, sustainable, decentralized energy solutions that fit the climate better","“This is a tropical island, you get sun most times of the year… You won’t believe how many people want to get into solar, or be offgrid in case something like this happens again","There’s a huge market,” Diaz says","But Puerto Rico also needs to raise climate awareness among internet stakeholders","Despite working in a storm-prone area, the internet industry doesn’t always build sustainably","Shernon Osepa, Regional Affairs Manager for Latin America & The Caribbean Bureau at ISOC, sees a need to address this problem","“These operators know that we live in a very vulnerable environment, but some of them are deploying networks as if we’re living in a region where these things don’t happen,” Osepa cautioned, noting that some Caribbean infrastructure is only rated to withstand category hurricanes, despite facing category - hurricanes","Opening data to the public is also key for the recovery","“We don’t have a picture of how bad the telecommunication is,” Diaz says","He argues that the Puerto Rico Broadband Taskforce should prioritize creating a map of what parts of the island are without broadband service","Puerto Rico suffered from broken infrastructure and budget cuts long before the storm","The U","S","Federal Emergency Management Agency has contributed large sums to emergency repairs, but politicians are reluctant to supply the funds necessary for a complete infrastructure redesign","Instead they opt for quick-fixes, or even plans that are not in Puerto Rico’s best interests","In response to tight budgets, Diaz encourages creative thinking and more sustainable solutions","For instance, he says, existing internet access grants for public schools could be used to create “anchor institutions” that help supply internet to people in surrounding communities","Climate change is rapidly creating new hurdles for internet advocates in the Caribbean and around the world","We can expect more hurricanes and natural disasters for sure","This urgently calls for alternative and regionally appropriate infrastructure to be deployed already today","Further reading Report from the Field: Post-Hurricane Connectivity in the
